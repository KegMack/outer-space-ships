        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <section>
          <p>This program was created using the following programs and languages</p>
           <ul>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>JQuery</li>
            <li>JqueryUI</li>
            <li>CSS3</li>
            <li>HTML5</li>
            <li>Sublime text editor</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It is meant to be a throwback to past-generation  games such as Arkanoid, by Taito, and Breakout, by Atari. </p><p>  It has been a goal of mine as long as I can   remember to create a functional video game, and this was  a great opportunity to accomplish that, while also   learning the above languages.</p>
